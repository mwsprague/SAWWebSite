        <h1>Frequently asked questions: </h1>

        <p class="q">Q. What driver was the SAW118 designed around?</p>
        <p class="a">A. This cabinet uses the Peavey Low Rider 18" subwoofer which is rated at 800 watts RMS. It actually uses similar volume and vents as Peavey's 7.0 CU FT Medium cabinet.</p>

        <p class="q">Q. So why would I buy these plans?</p>
        <p class="a">A. These plans have all the math worked out for the correct volume and vents and take into account the volume of the driver, handles, internal braces.</p>

        <p class="q">Q. What's up with all the handles?</p>
        <p class="a">A. Have you ever had a gig at a sub-optimal venue where you have to shove a sub under a table or in some less than perfect location and really needed a handle on front or sides to help move it? That's why!
            These handles are all built into the cabinet structure and are actually integrated into the internal bracing making for a very rigid cabinet.
        </p>

        <p class="q">Q. How much plywood is required?</p>
        <p class="a">A. The cut sheet included in the plans uses a single 4'x8'sheet of 3/4" plywood. It also requires a  small amount of 1/2" for the vents and handle pocket boxes. The dimensions are also
        optimized for a 5'x5' sheet of plywood but it requires about 1 and a 1/3 sheets of 5'x5'. </p>

        <p class="q">Q. Can I build the cabinet myself?</p>
        <p class="a">Yes, if you have decent woodworking skills. Unlike the LA112 and LA206, this cabinet can actually be built without a tablesaw. However, a 10" tablesaw will make cutting out the parts much
        easier.</p>

        <p class="q">Q. Where can I get the plans?</p>
        <p class="a">A. Please see the <a href="plans.html">Plans </a> page</p>
