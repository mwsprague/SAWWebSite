        <h1>Frequently asked questions: </h1>

        <p class="q">Q. How does the LA206 compare to the LA112?</p>
        <p class="a">A. Aside from the obvious of the LA206 being a dual 6.5" verses a single 12", the HF section uses a commercial waveguide from PRV audio that is a very good fit for this cabinet and makes the construction much easier.
        It is a very compact cabinet but does not get a loud as the LA112. However, it has excellent characteristics that make it a great fit for smaller venues and vocal applications. </p>

        <p class="q">Q. What do you mean by "scalable"?</p>
        <p class="a">A. These can be scaled down to only single cabinet on a pole over a subwoofer for small rooms all the way up to multiple cabinets locked together and flown in a hanging "J" line array configuration. Often a band will need as assortment of speakers to cover everything from coffee shops to larger outdoor venues. You will see someone dragging in a large, dual 15" main into a small room which is too much speaker or someone using a couple of small mains in an outdoor location - both not a good fit. With the LA112, you can stack as many or as few as the situation requires and as your budget can afford.</p>

        <p class="q">Q. What do you mean by "Open" design?</p>

        <p class="a">A. Most Line Array designs use proprietary, custom built components which can greatly raise the
            cost and be very expensive to repair as you are stuck buying their replacement components. In fact, it is
            common practice in many industries to change a part just so they can charge more for parts and repairs even
            though a stock part would have been just fine. Without an engineering degree and lots of research, one is
            stuck buying the original part at an inflated price. If you have ever had to replace a motor controller
            board on your home air conditioner or a heater for your spa you will know what I mean.
        </p>

        <p class="a">The LA206 uses parts that anyone can readily buy from Parts Express or USpeaker and we provide the
            part numbers and replacement options.</p>

        <p class="q">Q. How many LA206a cabinets can I run with a single amp?</p>
        <p class="a">A. Each cabinet is 8 ohms so 2-3 depending on the wattage of the amp. 2 per amp channel is 4 ohms and 3 per amp channel is approximately 2.6 ohms.  </p>

        <p class="q">Q. Can I build the cabinets myself?</p>
        <p class="a">Yes, if you have decent skills in woodworking with access to a 10" table saw and other standard
            woodworking tools you can purchase plans. </p>

        <p class="q">Q. Can I build the metal rigging myself?</p>
        <p class="a">A. Yes, if you have decent metal working skills and access to a metal shop. </p>

        <p class="q">Q. Can I build the wood cabinet and purchase the metal rigging separately?</p>
        <p class="a">A. Yes, the metal rigging can be purchased separately. </p>

        <p class="q">Q. Where can I get the plans?</p>
        <p class="a">A. Please see the <a href="plans.html">Plans </a> page</p>
